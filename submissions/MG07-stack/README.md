Hi! 👋 I'm **Manaswi Goyal**, and this is my first ever web project.  
It's a simple interactive portfolio page I built while learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — with a lot of help from ChatGPT (for generating, understanding, and improving code).

## 🌐 Overview

This project is a **personal portfolio webpage** that includes:
- My name and a short tagline.
- A **link to my LinkedIn profile**.
- A **dynamic background color system** that changes when you click different buttons.
- An **"About Me"** section that appears when you click the hexagon-shaped "About Me" button, with a back arrow to return.

Even though it looks simple, I’ve been experimenting with concepts like:
- `clip-path` shapes (for the hexagonal button),
- gradients and transitions in CSS,
- DOM manipulation in JavaScript,
- and a general understanding of how all three files (HTML, CSS, JS) work together.
