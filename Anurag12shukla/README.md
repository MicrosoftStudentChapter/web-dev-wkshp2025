# Anurag Shukla — Workshop Portfolio

This folder contains my submission for the Microsoft Student Chapter Version Control & Web Dev workshop.

## What's Inside

- `index.html` — a single-page portfolio with my name, tagline, about section, and contact links.
- `style.css` — global styling for typography, layout, and responsive tweaks.
- `script.js` — three interactive buttons that toggle between Daylight, Sunset, and Midnight color schemes and a small footer update.

## How It Works

1. Open `index.html` in any modern browser.
2. Use the theme buttons to switch background colors on the fly.
3. Review the about section and contact links to learn more about me.

## Workshop Checklist

- [x] Name and tagline
- [x] About section and optional links
